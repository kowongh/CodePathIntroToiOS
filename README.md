# CodePathIntroToiOS

This is my intro to iOS pre work test for CodePath. In addition to the steps I also implemented a frame and alpha animation as well as implemented some basic Autolayout constraints on the views.

The main view controller has a nested view with the total and tip labels inside which are together being animated via the x position.
