# CodePathIntroToiOS

This is my intro to iOS pre work test for CodePath. In addition to basic requirements, I also implemented:

* UIView animations.
* Implemented AutoLayout.
* Used locale currency and currency thousands separator.
* Implemented a dark mode.
* Saved the bill amount for up to 10 minutes using NSDate.
* The keyboard is open automatically and ready to be edited.

Both view controllers have nested views with the UI elements insdie, so I could easily animate their x origin properties and alpha. You can tap the bar button item "Settings" to change the default tip amount and color mode theme.
